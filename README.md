## Description

This a very simple bubble shooter game created with only HTML and JavaScript. It allows users to try to clear the board of all bubbles by shooting new bubbles at groups of the same color. When 3 or more bubbles of the same color are connected they disappear. If there are any bubbles attached to the group only by other bubbles that disappear then they will fall also. Those bubbles attached to the top of the gameboard will not fall, only disappear upon aggregation. The rows of bubbles will continuously shift down and a new row added to the top after a certain number of moves. If the bottom row of bubbles reaches the bottom of the game board then the game ends. The user can see their score at the bottom of the game and begin a new game after "game over" by clicking on the gameboard.

## Installation

There is no installation needed, the game can be played in the browser as-is.

## Usage

To use, simply open the application in a browser window and begin by aiming the current bubble at the cluster and clicking to shoot it. The goal is to hit another bubble of the same color to make a cluster of at least 3 so they can disappear until all bubbles are gone. Refreshing the page will reset the game to another random cluster.
